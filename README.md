How-to:

1. After first launch you will be asked for provide pathes to your mesa repository and to output folders (separated for x32 and x64 folders)
2. Now mesa uses meson build and compiles only i965 in debug mode
3. To run script - use "source build_meson.sh"
4. Note that after installation needed exports will be done automaticaly
